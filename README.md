# HeadHunter 42 :construction_worker:

## What is it?

The 'HeadHunter 42' is an open source project from Codeminer 42
which pretends to help companies to organize and automate the
hiring process.

We are focused at first in solving our problem, but in a future maybe make the tool even more portable
and easy to use by any person out there!

## Dependencies 

The application was created with the following environment:

- `Ruby 2.5.0`
- `Rails 5.1.6`
- `PostgreSQL 10.2`

###### Gems

The following gems were used in the project as well:

* gems pending 

## How to setup?

1. First check if your Rails and Ruby are matching the versions above;
2. Also, install Yarn in your machine if you don't have it installed yet.
Check out [Yarn's website](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/) for how to setup for your machine.
4. Run `yarn install`;
5. After, run `bundle install` and check if any of the gems in the gemfile are up-to-date;
6. If not, run `bundle update` or install the missing gems in your machine;
7. With the project environment created, run `rails db:create`;
8. And then run `rails db:migrate`, that will get your database set and ready to go;

## How to run the test suite?

1. Now just run `bundle exec rspec` and see the API being tested.

## How to deploy?

For the deploy we are using Heroku, and seeing how the application is behaving,
to deploy it on Heroku we can do the following command.

     heroku create
     
That will start a new Heroku repository for you. Don't worry about the name,
it's auto generated by Heroku.

Now, just put the following command on the terminal:

    git push heroku master
    
Done!, you master branch was sent to Heroku's repository and was deployed.

For additional information of how to deploy it's worth it visiting this [tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#prerequisites-installing-git-and-the-heroku-cli)
made by Heroku. They explain with more details and different functionalities.

Remember to have a Heroku and Git installed and configured in your machine. You can 
find information about that in [Heroku's website](https://www.heroku.com/) and at [Git's website](https://git-scm.com/).
